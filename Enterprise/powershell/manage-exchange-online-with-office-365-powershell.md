# Manage Exchange Online with PowerShell

*This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise.*

One of the primary tasks of any Microsoft Exchange Online administrator is managing mailboxes and getting reports on them. Although you can accomplish some of these tasks in the Exchange admin center, other tasks are much quicker and easier in PowerShell for Microsoft 365. For more information, see the following topics:
  
- [Use Exchange Online PowerShell to display mailbox information](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-user-mailboxes/use-powershell-to-display-mailbox-information)
    
- [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-server/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions)
